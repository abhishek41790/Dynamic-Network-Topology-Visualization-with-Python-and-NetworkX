# Dynamic-Network-Topology-Visualization-with-Python-and-NetworkX
In this task, Python with NetworkX and Matplotlib is used to visualize a dynamic network topology. Nodes represent devices and edges represent UDP communication links. The network updates in real time, making it suitable for monitoring and analysis of changing network behavior.
