# Dynamic-Network-Topology-Visualization-with-Python-and-NetworkX
In this task, Python with NetworkX and Matplotlib is used to visualize a dynamic network topology. Nodes represent devices and edges represent UDP communication links. The network updates in real time, making it suitable for monitoring and analysis of changing network behavior.


# Dynamic Network Topology Visualization using Python

## 📌 Objective
This project demonstrates how to visualize a **dynamic network topology** using Python.
Nodes represent devices and edges represent communication links (UDP-like behavior).

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
- UDP (conceptual representation)

---

## 📥 Input
- Number of nodes (devices)
- Randomly generated connections between nodes
- Network updates dynamically every second

---

## 📤 Output
- Live graphical visualization of the network
- Nodes and edges update dynamically
- Console message after successful execution
